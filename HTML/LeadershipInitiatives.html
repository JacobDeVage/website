    <td> Tennis Social Media Manager</td>
    <td> During my Sophomore year, my tennis team was not receiving any social media attention or coaching support compated to other teams. 
        I took the initiative to create an Instagram page for my University's tennis team. I post match results, season schedules, and more. 
        During this time, another teammate and I felt we weren't receiving equal funding 
        and attention in terms of receiving gear and the quality of our courts. 
        We took the initiative to speak to the athletic director. 
        After the discussion we were promised matching uniforms, 
        access to software that allowed me to create edits for the tennis page, and funding to fix our tennis courts.
        The Tennis Team's Instagram page can be found here!

    <td> Resident Assistant</td>
    <td> During my Freshmen year of college, I watched my Resident assistant help create community in my hall. During the end of my freshmen year, I interviewed and recived an offer for the RA position. My goal was to create community and learn more about different walks of life. During my two years as an RA, I have learned more about different backgrounds, created community through hall events, and created a safe space where people feel comfortable living and expressing themselves.</td>
